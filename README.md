# Preprocessing-Image-Recognition
Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection

This is a group academic project which was done by me and my teammate in NEU.(Detail infomation can be find in Report part.)
This project means to test the how the preprocessing( crop image size ) will affect the Convolutional Neural Network we build performance.

Detail tensorboard chart can be find in the report.
The code are in 2 seperate files each for either preprocessing or final model.


1. pip install tensorflow
2.	use the code to train original pictures and see the result
3.	use the same code to train pre-processed pictures  and see the result
4.	compare the 2 results
5.	cd to the directory
6.	run code tensorboard --logdir=’test_log’
7.	tensorboard result is available through port 6006

Our dataset is too large so it may take 1 hour and a half to get all results.
